This report explores the exciting world of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and how it can be used to detect license plate in cars. TinyML is operated on low-power microcontrollers boards with extensive hardware extraction [7]. With the advancement in technology there is also an increase a criminal activities and people day by day are bypassing the cyber laws. This project is a simple implementation of object detection with many possibilities yet untouched. TinyML is a cool technology that lets small devices like Rasberry pi do smart things on their own, without needing big computers far away. This opens up lots of possibilities, like keeping an eye on the target vehicle or helping with identifying fake plates. We focused on using Ultralytics, to make a smart assistant called Yolo-v8. This assistant can zoom out number plates from the crowds. Instead of using a camera, we teach it using a set of pictures and videos we already have, making sure the computer knows where the no. plates are in each picture [1]. This shows how TinyML is versatile and can handle different kinds of data situations. The report guides you through the steps, starting with getting the dataset ready, teaching the model, and then putting it onto a smart edge board. The goal is to show how this tech can be useful for spotting vehicle number plates, with potential uses in tracking and assisting with any govt. uses. As we go through the steps, we highlight why it's cool to have machines making smart decisions right on the device, without always needing help from big computers somewhere else.
